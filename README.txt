This is a repository for Lesson 2, Small Programs. I will push my progress on a frequent basis from now on, although some programs aren't quite finished or could be missing bonus features I haven't quite figured out yet. 

I've been taking a lot of time to research how every little thing works in order to develop an understanding of every process involved in programming. The internet is a boundless resource for techniques and has a supportive coding community.
